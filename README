Hello!

My Name is Prometheus and this is meant to be a simple tutorial on using
terraform to create a new EC2 instance that you can connect to via SSH and
an AWS key-pair.

Before we get started, here are some prerequisites that we need to go over. I
am doing this on windows, but ideally these directions should be platform
agnostic.

~prerequisites
1.) This requires an AWS account. AWS offers a free tier with compute
recourses like EC2 instances that will be available for your first year. Just
remember I am not responsible for any costs you may incur after that first year
or if AWS decided to remove the free tier!

2.) You will need the AWS CLI which can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/cli/.
Once you have this downloaded, you will need to configure your AWS account for
use with the CLI. More information on that can be found at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html


This guide is still a work in progress so please that in mind if you stumble
upon this github repo before it is ready.
